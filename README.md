Source code for the paper:  ***De Novo* Drug Design by Iterative Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning with graph-based Molecular Quality Assessment**



## Overview

Generating molecules of high quality and drug-likeness in the vast chemical space is a big challenge in the drug discovery. Most existing generating methods focus on diversity and novelty of molecules, but ignoring the drug potentials of the generated molecules during the generation process. In this study, we present
a novel *de novo* multi-objective quality assessment-based drug design approach QADD, which integrates an iterative refinement framework with a novel graph-based molecule quality assessment model for drug potentials. QADD designs a multi-objective deep reinforcement learning pipeline to generate molecules with multiple desired properties iteratively, where a graph neural network-based model for accurate molecular quality assessment on drug potentials is introduced to guide molecule generation.
